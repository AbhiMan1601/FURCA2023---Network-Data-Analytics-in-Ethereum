NETWORK DATA ANALYTICS IN ETHEREUM

WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE ETHEREUM IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL 5133

By Abhimanyu Nag

ABSTRACT

A lot of research has been done on reaping the fruits of Blockchain Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Blockchains have made our lives much easier in terms of intelligent applications like healthcare and they have also solved some very core problems in privacy and decentralization. Ethereum, one of the most widely used blockchains, is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of decentralized apps. Every day millions of developers and investors interact with the Ethereum protocol and unbeknownst to them, every move they make in the system essentially results in the accumulation of data which, though tiresome to acquire, are extremely valuable in terms of assessing the network metrics. Through this research, we analyze the performance of the Ethereum network, identify potential performance degradation issues and investment opportunities, ultimately showing the importance of such endeavor through the example of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal 5133, a proposal submitted by our team at Nethermind to the core developers of the Ethereum protocol, which leveraged the application of statistical analyses on the network and the result of this research was crucial to launch the Merge, which was the biggest event in Ethereum's history and impacted millions worldwide. Another aim of this research is to help make investment decisions by figuring out which factors would prove to be good predictors of Ethereum's stock price and how to quantify crowd behaviour to predict rewards. This work has been cited in the Ethereum yellow paper and has been lauded by various journals for its importance.
